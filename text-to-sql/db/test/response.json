        "response_easy_language": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain these medical conditions in simpler terms:\n\n1. **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**: This is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood cells. In AML, the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets. These abnormal cells do not function properly and can build up in the bone marrow and bloodstream, crowding out healthy cells. This condition was diagnosed on March 31, 2015.\n\n2. **Febrile Neutropenia**: This is a serious complication of cancer treatment where the patient has a low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and a fever. White blood cells help the body fight infections, so having too few can increase the risk of infection. This condition was also diagnosed on March 31, 2015.\n\n3. **Bacteremia**: This is a medical condition characterized by the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. It can occur spontaneously, or as a result of an infection or a medical procedure. Bacteremia can lead to serious infections elsewhere in the body if not treated promptly. This condition was diagnosed on March 31, 2015.\n\n4. **Viral Sinusitis**: This is an inflammation or swelling of the tissue lining the sinuses, caused by a viral infection. It's often associated with a cold and may be accompanied by a runny nose, nasal congestion, and facial pain. This condition was diagnosed from October 29 to November 6, 2015.\n\n5. **Acute Viral Pharyngitis**: This is a viral infection that causes inflammation and swelling of the pharynx (the back of the throat). Symptoms often include a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and fever. This condition was diagnosed from January 25 to February 5, 2016.\n\n6. **Streptococcal Sore Throat**: Also known as strep throat, this is a bacterial infection that causes inflammation and pain in the throat. It's caused by group A Streptococcus bacteria. Other symptoms can include fever, swollen lymph nodes, and white patches on the tonsils. This condition was diagnosed from October 20 to November 3, 2019."
