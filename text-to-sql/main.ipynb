The first diagnosis is for a condition called \\\\\"Stress\\\\\". This period of stress started on January 8, 2019, and it continued until February 5, 2019. Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It can come from any event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous. Stress is the body\\'s reaction to a challenge or demand. In short, it\\'s your body\\'s way of preparing to face a tough situation.\\\\n\\\\n2. The second diagnosis is for a condition called \\\\\"Myocardial Infarction\\\\\". This condition started on April 9, 2019, and according to the information provided, it appears to be ongoing as there is no end date listed. Myocardial Infarction is another term for a heart attack. A heart attack occurs when the blood supply to a part of the heart is interrupted. This is usually caused by a blockage in one or more of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. The blockage is typically a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries). The interrupted blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.\"}'"
