# DEX34: Distribution of drug quantity

## Description
This query is used to provide summary statistics for drug quantity (quantity) across all drug exposure records:
the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile,
the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.

## Query

The following is a sample run of the query.

```sql
SELECT
    MIN(stat_value)                                                                    AS min_value,
    MAX(stat_value)                                                                    AS max_value,
    AVG(stat_value)                                                                    AS avg_value,
    ROUND(STDEV(stat_value), 1)                                                        AS STDEV_value,
    MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .25 * population_size THEN 9999 ELSE stat_value END)      AS percentile_25,
    MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .50 * population_size THEN 9999 ELSE stat_value END)      AS median_value,
    MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .75 * population_size THEN 9999 ELSE stat_value END)      AS percentile_75

FROM (
  SELECT
    quantity                                                     AS stat_value,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY quantity)                        AS order_nr,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cdm.drug_exposure WHERE quantity > 0) AS population_size
  FROM cdm.drug_exposure
  -- Retrieve only positive quantities
  WHERE quantity > 0
) ordered_data;
```

## Input
