The following is a sample run of the query. The input parameters are highlighted in  blue.

```sql
SELECT c.concept_name AS specialty,
       COUNT(*)       AS prescriptions_count
  FROM cdm.drug_exposure drug
  JOIN cdm.provider p
    ON p.provider_id = drug.provider_id
  JOIN vocabularies.concept c
    ON c.concept_id  = p.specialty_concept_id
 WHERE c.vocabulary_id           = 'Specialty'
   AND drug.drug_concept_id      = 2213473  /* Influenza virus vaccine */
   AND c.standard_concept  = 'S'
 GROUP BY c.concept_name
 ORDER BY prescriptions_count desc;
