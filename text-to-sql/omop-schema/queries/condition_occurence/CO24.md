# CO24: Counts of genders, stratified by condition

## Description
This query is used to count all genders (gender_concept_id), stratified by condition (condition_concept_id). All existing value combinations are summarized. Since some of the conditions have values only for one of the genders, in order not to present the concept id and name twice, a CASE clause is used.

## Query
```sql
SELECT
      CASE
        WHEN male_id<> null THEN male_id
        ELSE female_id
      END                                  AS concept_id,

      CASE
        WHEN male_concept_name<> null THEN male_concept_name
        ELSE female_concept_name
      END                                  AS name,
        count_male,
        count_female

                               )
