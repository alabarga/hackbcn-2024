# CO21: Distribution of age, stratified by condition

## Description
This query is used to provide summary statistics for the age across all condition occurrence records stratified by condition (condition_concept_id):
the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values.
The age value is defined by the earliest condition occurrence. The input to the query is a value (or a comma-separated list of values) of a condition_concept_id.
