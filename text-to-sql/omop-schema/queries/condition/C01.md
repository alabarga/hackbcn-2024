# C01: Find condition by concept ID

## Description
Find condition by condition ID is the lookup for obtaining condition or disease concept details associated with a concept identifier. This query is a tool for quick reference for the name, class, level and source vocabulary details associated with a concept identifier, either SNOMED-CT clinical finding or MedDRA.
This query is equivalent to  G01, but if the concept is not in the condition domain the query still returns the concept details with the Is_Disease_Concept_Flag field set to 'No'.

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query to run a search for specific disease concept ID. 

```sql
SELECT
  c.concept_id       AS condition_concept_id,
  c.concept_name     AS condition_concept_name,
  c.concept_code     AS condition_concept_code,
  c.concept_class_id AS condition_concept_class,
  c.vocabulary_id    AS condition_concept_vocab_id,
  CASE c.vocabulary_id
  WHEN 'SNOMED'
    THEN CASE lower(c.concept_class_id)
         WHEN 'clinical finding'
           THEN 'Yes'
         ELSE 'No' END
  WHEN 'MedDRA'
    THEN 'Yes'
  ELSE 'No'
  END                AS is_disease_concept_flag
FROM vocabularies.concept AS c
WHERE
  c.concept_id = 192671 AND 
  c.invalid_reason IS NULL
;
```

## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | ------------------------------------------- |
|  Concept ID |  192671 |  Yes | Concept Identifier for 'GI - Gastrointestinal haemorrhage' |

## Output

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------- |
|  Condition_Concept_ID |  Condition concept Identifier entered as input |
|  Condition_Concept_Name |  Name of the standard condition concept |
|  Condition_Concept_Code |  Concept code of the standard concept in the source vocabulary |
|  Condition_Concept_Class |  Concept class of standard vocabulary concept |
|  Condition_Concept_Vocab_ID  |  Vocabulary the standard concept is derived from as vocabulary code |
|  Is_Disease_Concept_Flag |  Flag indicating whether the Concept ID belongs to a disease concept. 'Yes' if disease concept, 'No' if not a disease concept |
