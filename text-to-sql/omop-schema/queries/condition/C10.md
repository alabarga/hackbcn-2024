## Description
This query enables a search of all anatomical sites using a keyword entered as input. The resulting concepts could be used in query  C11 to identify diseases occurring at a certain anatomical site.

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query to list all anatomical site concept IDs specified using a keyword as input.

```sql
SELECT
  c.concept_id       AS anatomical_site_id,
  c.concept_name     AS anatomical_site_name,
  c.concept_code     AS anatomical_site_code,
  c.concept_class_id AS anatomical_site_class,
  c.standard_concept AS anatomical_standard_concept,
  c.vocabulary_id    AS anatomical_site_vocab_id
FROM vocabularies.concept AS c
WHERE
  lower(c.concept_class_id) = 'body structure' AND
  lower(c.concept_name) LIKE '%epiglottis%' AND
  c.invalid_reason IS NULL
;
```
## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Keyword for pathogen |  'Epiglottis' |  Yes | Keyword should be placed in a single quote |
