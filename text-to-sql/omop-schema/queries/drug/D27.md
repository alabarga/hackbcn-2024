# D27: Find drugs of a brand

## Description
This query is designed to extract all clinical and branded drugs associated with a branded ingredient (or simply a brand name). Since the brand names are not part of the standard drug hierarchy in the OMOP vocabulary, the association between brand name and generic/branded drugs is made using a set of relationships.
The query requires a brand name concept ID as the input. Brand name concept IDs can be obtained by querying the Concept table for a concept class of 'Brand Name'.

## Query
