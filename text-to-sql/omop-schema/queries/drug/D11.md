# D11: Find source codes by drug class

## Description
This query is designed to extract codes from a non-standard drug vocabulary that belong to a therapeutic class. The query accepts a therapeutic class concept ID and the vocabualry ID of the desired source vocabulary as input and returns all codes that are included under that class and that belong to a source vocabulary. This query could be used to derive e.g. all NDC codes that belong to a certain drug class.

## Query
```sql
SELECT  d.concept_code,
        d.vocabulary_id,
        v.vocabulary_name
 FROM vocabularies.concept_ancestor ca
        JOIN vocabularies.concept d on d.concept_id = ca.descendant_concept_id
        JOIN vocabularies.concept a on a.concept_id = ca.ancestor_concept_id
        JOIN vocabularies.vocabulary v on d.vocabulary_id = v.vocabulary_id
 WHERE  ca.ancestor_concept_id = 21506108
   AND  a.vocabulary_id = 'NDC'
   AND  d.domain_id = 'Drug'
   AND  (getdate() >= d.valid_start_date)
   AND  (getdate() <= d.valid_end_date);
```
