# OP16: Count of genders, stratified by year and age group

## Description
This query is used to count the genders (gender_concept_id) across all observation period records stratified by year and age group. The age groups are calculated as 10 year age bands from the age of a person at the observation period start date. All possible value combinations are summarized.

## Query
```sql
SELECT
  observation_year,
  age_group,
  gender,
  COUNT(*) AS num_people
FROM
  (SELECT
    DISTINCT person_id ,
    YEAR(observation_period_start_date ) AS observation_year
   FROM cdm.observation_period
  ) AS z
INNER JOIN
  (SELECT
    person_id,
    gender ,
    CONCAT(CAST(FLOOR( age / 10 ) * 10 AS VARCHAR),' to ',CAST(( FLOOR( age / 10 ) * 10 ) + 9 AS VARCHAR)) AS age_group
   FROM
    (SELECT
      person_id                                        AS person_id,
      ISNULL( concept_name, 'MISSING' )                AS gender,
      year_of_birth                                    AS year_of_birth,
      YEAR(first_observation_date ) - year_of_birth    AS age
    FROM
      ( SELECT
          person.person_id,
          gender_concept_id,
          year_of_birth,
          MIN( observation_period_start_date ) AS first_observation_date
        FROM cdm.observation_period
        INNER JOIN cdm.person
        ON observation_period.person_id = person.person_id
        GROUP BY person.person_id, gender_concept_id, year_of_birth
      ) AS y
    LEFT OUTER JOIN vocabularies.concept
    ON concept_id = gender_concept_id
    WHERE year_of_birth IS NOT NULL
    ) AS w
  WHERE age >= 0
  ) AS m
  ON z.person_id = m.person_id
GROUP BY
  observation_year,
  age_group,
  gender
ORDER BY
  observation_year,
  age_group,
  gender;
```
