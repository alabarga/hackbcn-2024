# OP13: Distribution of observation period start dates

## Description
This query is used to to provide summary statistics for observation period start dates (observation_period_start_date) across all observation period records: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.

## Query
```sql
WITH op AS
  (SELECT
      DATEDIFF(day,DATEFROMPARTS(1900,1,1),observation_period_start_date) diffs,
      ROW_NUMBER() over (order by observation_period_start_date) AS order_nr,
      CAST(CONVERT(VARCHAR, observation_period_start_date, 112) AS INTEGER) AS start_date,
      observation_period_start_date AS org_start_date,
      COUNT(*)OVER() AS population_size
   FROM cdm.observation_period
  )

SELECT
  MIN(org_start_date) AS min_start_date,
  MAX(org_start_date) AS max_start_date,
  DATEADD(day, ROUND(AVG(CAST(diffs AS BIGINT)),1), DATEFROMPARTS(1900,1,1)) AS avg_start_date,
  ROUND(STDEV(start_date), 1)                                             AS STDEV_days,
  MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .25 * population_size THEN DATEFROMPARTS(9999,12,31) ELSE org_start_date END) AS percentile_25,
  MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .50 * population_size THEN DATEFROMPARTS(9999,12,31) ELSE org_start_date END) AS median,
  MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .75 * population_size THEN DATEFROMPARTS(9999,12,31) ELSE org_start_date END) AS percentile_75
FROM op
;
```

## Input
