# CO15: Distribution of number of distinct conditions persons have

## Description
This query is used to provide summary statistics for the number of different distinct conditions (condition_concept_id) of all persons: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.
