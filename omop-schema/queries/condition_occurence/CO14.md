    WHERE condition_concept_id = 372409
    GROUP BY condition_type_concept_id
    ) AS condition_type_count
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT concept_id, 
           concept_name
    FROM vocabularies.concept
    ) AS type_concept 
    ON condition_type_count.condition_type_concept_id=type_concept.concept_id
ORDER BY condition_type_freq;
