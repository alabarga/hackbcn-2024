# C03: Translate a SNOMED-CT concept into a MedDRA concept

## Description
This query accepts a SNOMED-CT concept ID as input and returns details of the equivalent MedDRA concepts.

The relationships in the vocabulary associate MedDRA 'Preferred Term' to SNOMED-CT 'clinical findings'. The respective hierarchy for MedDRA and SNOMED-CT can be used to traverse up and down the hierarchy of each of these individual vocabularies.

Also, not all SNOMED-CT clinical findings are mapped to a MedDRA concept in the vocabulary.

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query to list MedDRA equivalents for SNOMED-CT concept whose concept ID is entered as input.

```sql
SELECT
  d.concept_id        AS snomed_concept_id,
  d.concept_name      AS snomed_concept_name,
  d.concept_code      AS snomed_concept_code,
  d.concept_class_id  AS snomed_concept_class,
  cr.relationship_id  AS relationship_id,
  r.relationship_name AS relationship_name,
  a.concept_id        AS meddra_concept_id,
  a.concept_name      AS meddra_concept_name,
  a.concept_code      AS meddra_concept_code,
  a.concept_class_id  AS meddra_concept_class
FROM vocabularies.concept_relationship AS cr
  JOIN vocabularies.concept AS d ON cr.concept_id_1 = d.concept_id
  JOIN vocabularies.concept AS a ON cr.concept_id_2 = a.concept_id
  JOIN vocabularies.relationship AS r ON cr.relationship_id = r.relationship_id
WHERE
  cr.relationship_id = 'SNOMED - MedDRA eq' AND
  cr.concept_id_1 = 312327 AND
  cr.invalid_reason IS NULL
;
```
