# DER11: Distribution of drug era start dates

## Description
This query is used to to provide summary statistics for drug era start dates (drug_era_start_date) across all drug era records: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.

## Query
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT MIN(tt.start_date) OVER () AS min_date
,      MAX(tt.start_date) OVER () AS max_date
,      DATEADD(day, (AVG(CAST(tt.start_date_num AS BIGINT)) OVER ()), tt.min_date) AS avg_date
,      ROUND(STDEV(tt.start_date_num) OVER (), 0) AS STDEV_days
,      DATEADD(day, MIN(CASE WHEN tt.order_nr < .25 * tt.population_size THEN 9999 ELSE tt.start_date_num END) over (), tt.min_date) AS percentile_25_date
,      DATEADD(day, MIN(CASE WHEN tt.order_nr < .50 * tt.population_size THEN 9999 ELSE tt.start_date_num END) over (), tt.min_date) AS median_date
,      DATEADD(day, MIN(CASE WHEN tt.order_nr < .75 * tt.population_size THEN 9999 ELSE tt.start_date_num END) over (), tt.min_date) AS percentile_75_date
FROM (
       SELECT DATEDIFF(day, (MIN(t.drug_era_start_date) OVER()), t.drug_era_start_date) AS start_date_num
       ,      t.drug_era_start_date AS start_date
       ,      MIN(t.drug_era_start_date) OVER() min_date
       ,      MAX(t.drug_era_start_date) OVER() max_date
       ,      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY t.drug_era_start_date) order_nr
       ,      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cdm.drug_era) AS population_size
       FROM cdm.drug_era t
) tt
GROUP BY tt.order_nr
,        tt.population_size
,        tt.min_date
,        tt.start_date
,        tt.start_date_num;
```
