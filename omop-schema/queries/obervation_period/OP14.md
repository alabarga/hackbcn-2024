# OP14: Distribution of age, stratified by gender

## Description
This query is used to provide summary statistics for the age across all observation records stratified by gender (gender_concept_id): the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. The age value is defined by the earliest observation date. Age is summarized for all existing gender_concept_id values.

## Query
```sql
WITH t AS 
  ( SELECT 
      p.person_id, 
      ISNULL( concept_name, 'MISSING' ) AS gender,
      YEAR(first_observation_date ) - year_of_birth AS age
    FROM -- person, first observation period date
      ( SELECT 
          person_id,
          MIN( observation_period_start_date ) AS first_observation_date
        FROM cdm.observation_period
        GROUP BY person_id
      ) AS p
    INNER JOIN cdm.person 
    ON p.person_id = person.person_id
    LEFT OUTER JOIN vocabularies.concept 
    ON person.gender_concept_id = concept.concept_id
    WHERE year_of_birth IS NOT NULL
