# OP15: Counts of age, stratified by gender

## Description
This query is used to count the age across all observation records stratified by gender (gender_concept_id). The age value is defined by the earliest observation date. Age is summarized for all existing gender_concept_id values.

## Query
```sql
SELECT
  age,
  gender,
  COUNT(*) AS num_people
FROM
  ( SELECT
      w.person_id,
      ISNULL( concept_name, 'MISSING' )                     AS gender,
      YEAR(first_observation_date ) - year_of_birth         AS age
    FROM
      ( SELECT
          person_id,
          MIN( observation_period_start_date ) AS first_observation_date
        FROM cdm.observation_period
        GROUP BY person_id
      ) AS w
     INNER JOIN cdm.person
     ON w.person_id = person.person_id
     LEFT OUTER JOIN vocabularies.concept
     ON person.gender_concept_id = concept.concept_id
