# D22: Find drugs by class and dose form

## Description
This query is designed to return a list of drug concept IDs that belong to a drug class and are of a certain dose form. The query ties together:

- Concept ancestor data to link drug concepts to therapeutic class
- RxNorm concept relationship 'RxNorm has dose form'

The results are combined to present a list of drugs from a specific therapeutic class with a specific dose form.

## Query
```sql
SELECT C.concept_id drug_concept_id,
C.concept_name drug_concept_name,
C.concept_code drug_concept_code
FROM vocabularies.concept C,
        vocabularies.concept_ancestor CA,
        vocabularies.concept_relationship CRF,
        vocabularies.concept F
WHERE CA.ancestor_concept_id = 4318008
        AND C.concept_id = CA.descendant_concept_id
        AND C.domain_id = 'Drug'
        AND C.standard_concept = 'S'
        AND CRF.concept_id_1 = C.concept_id
        AND CRF.relationship_ID = 'RxNorm has dose form'
        AND CRF.concept_id_2 = F.concept_id
        AND CHARINDEX(LOWER(REPLACE(REPLACE(F.concept_name, ' ', ''), '-', '')), LOWER(REPLACE(REPLACE('Nasal spray' , ' ', ''), '-', ''))) > 0
        AND (getdate() >= CRF.valid_start_date) AND (getdate() <= CRF.valid_end_date)
```
