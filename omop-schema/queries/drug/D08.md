# D08: Find drug classes for a drug or ingredient

## Description
This query is designed to return the therapeutic classes that associated with a drug. The query accepts a standard drug concept ID (e.g. as identified from query  G03) as the input. The drug concept can be a clinical or branded drug or pack (concept_level=1), or an ingredient (concept_level=2). The query returns one or more therapeutic classes associated with the drug based on the following classifications.).

- Enhanced Therapeutic Classification (ETC)
- Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification (ATC)
- NDF-RT Mechanism of Action (MoA)
- NDF-RT Physiologic effect
- NDF-RT Chemical structure
- VA Class

By default, the query returns therapeutic classes based on all the classification systems listed above. Additional clauses can be added to restrict the query to a single classification system.

## Query
```sql
SELECT
 c1.concept_id                 Class_Concept_Id,
 c1.concept_name               Class_Name,
 c1.concept_code               Class_Code,
 c1.concept_class_id              Classification,
 c1.vocabulary_id              Class_vocabulary_id,
 v1.vocabulary_name            Class_vocabulary_name,
 ca.min_levels_of_separation  Levels_of_Separation
FROM vocabularies.concept_ancestor   ca,
 vocabularies.concept                c1,
 vocabularies.vocabulary             v1
WHERE
ca.ancestor_concept_id = c1.concept_id
AND    c1.vocabulary_id IN ('NDFRT', 'ETC', 'ATC', 'VA Class')
AND    c1.concept_class_id IN ('ATC','VA Class','Mechanism of Action','Chemical Structure','ETC','Physiologic Effect')
AND    c1.vocabulary_id = v1.vocabulary_id
AND    ca.descendant_concept_id = 1545999
AND    (getdate() >= c1.valid_start_date) AND (getdate() <= c1.valid_end_date);
```

## Input

| Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   Drug Concept ID |  1545999 |  Yes | Concept Identifier from RxNorm for 'atorvastatin 20 MG Oral Tablet [Lipitor]' |
|  As of date |  Sysdate |  No | Valid record as of specific date. Current date â€“ sysdate is a default |

## Output

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | --- |
|  Class_Concept_ID |  Concept ID of the therapeutic class |
|  Class_Name |  Name of the therapeutic class |
|  Class_Code |  Concept Code of therapeutic class |
|  Classification |  Concept class of therapeutic class |
|  Class_Vocabulary_ID |  Vocabulary the therapeutic class is derived from, expressed as vocabulary ID |
|  Class_Vocabulary_Name |  Name of the vocabulary the therapeutic class is derived from |
|  Levels_of_Separation |  Levels of separation between the drug concept and the therapeutic class. Important for hierarchic classification systems to identify classes and subclasses for the drug. |

## Example output record

|  Field |  Value |
| --- | --- |
