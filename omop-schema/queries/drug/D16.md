# D16: Find drugs for an indication by indication type

## Description
This query provides all drugs that are indicated for a certain condition. In addition, it provides the type of indication: FDA-approved, off-label (both based on FDB indication classes) and may treat and may prevent (both based on NDF-RT). Indications have to be provided as FDB indicationsor NDF-RT.

## Query
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
 drug.concept_id      as drug_concept_id,
 drug.concept_name    as drug_concept_name,
 drug.concept_code    as drug_concept_code,
 rn.relationship_name as indication_type,
 indication_relation.relationship_id
FROM
  vocabularies.concept_relationship indication_relation
INNER JOIN vocabularies.concept_ancestor a
 ON a.ancestor_concept_id=indication_relation.concept_id_2
INNER JOIN vocabularies.concept drug
 ON drug.concept_id=a.descendant_concept_id
INNER JOIN vocabularies.relationship rn
 ON rn.relationship_id=indication_relation.relationship_id
WHERE indication_relation.concept_id_1 = 4345991
  AND drug.domain_id = 'Drug'
  AND drug.standard_concept = 'S'
  AND indication_relation.relationship_id in (
          'May treat',
        'Is off-label ind of',
        'Is FDA-appr ind of',
        'Inferred class of',
        'May be prevented by',
        'May prevent',
        'Has FDA-appr ind',
        'Has off-label ind',
        'May be treated by',
        'Has inferred class')
  AND (getdate() >= drug.valid_start_date) AND (getdate() <= drug.valid_end_date);
```
