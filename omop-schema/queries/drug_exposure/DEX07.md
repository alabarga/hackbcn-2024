## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. The input parameters are highlighted in  blue.

```sql
SELECT max(exposures) AS exposures_count
FROM (
	SELECT drug_exposure.person_id,
		COUNT(*) exposures
	FROM cdm.drug_exposure
	INNER JOIN cdm.person ON drug_exposure.person_id = person.person_id
	WHERE drug_concept_id IN (
			SELECT DISTINCT concept_id
			FROM cdm.concept
			WHERE domain_id = 'Drug'
				AND standard_concept = 'S'
			)
		AND drug_exposure_start_date >= DATEFROMPARTS(2017, 01, 01)
		AND drug_exposure_start_date <= DATEFROMPARTS(2017, 12, 31)
	GROUP BY drug_exposure.person_id
	) EV;
