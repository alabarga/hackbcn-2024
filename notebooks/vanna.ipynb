Concepts are derived from vocabularies, which represent clinical information across a domain (e.g. conditions, drugs, procedures) through the use of codes and associated descriptions. Some Concepts are designated Standard Concepts, meaning these Concepts can be used as normative expressions of a clinical entity within the OMOP Common Data Model and standardized analytics. Each Standard Concept belongs to one Domain, which defines the location where the Concept would be expected to occur within the data tables of the CDM. Concepts can represent broad categories ('Cardiovascular disease'), detailed clinical elements ('Myocardial infarction of the anterolateral wall'), or modifying characteristics and attributes that define Concepts at various levels of detail (severity of a disease, associated morphology, etc.). Records in the Standardized Vocabularies tables are derived from national or international vocabularies such as SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, and LOINC, or custom OMOP Concepts defined to cover various aspects of observational data analysis.\n",

      "This is the lookup for obtaining drug concept details associated with a concept identifier. This query is intended as a tool for quick reference for the name, class, level and source vocabulary details associated with a concept identifier.\n",
      "This query is equivalent to  G01, but if the concept is not in the drug domain the query still returns the concept details with the Is_Drug_Concept_Flag field set to 'No'.\n",
